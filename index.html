    <p>so i honestly don't know HTML that well at all<br>from what i can tell, it just seems like markdown with alot more stuff going on?<br>i've used Jupyter before but having this much stuff going on is a little overwhelming, but i'll figure this out<br></p>
    <p>this should be linked to wardlow.cc??? i'm not 100% sure, i'll have to check back on the status of cloudflare verifying the actual domain</p>
